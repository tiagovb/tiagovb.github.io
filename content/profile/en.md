# Biographical Background
Software engineer passionate about elegantly designed solutions. After studying economics (3yrs) and working in a bank (4yrs), I finally managed to enter the field I had always dreamed of.  

Now, with 10+ years of experience in agile software development environments, I prioritize technical excellence alongside soft skills and collaboration—empathy, communication, teamwork, and collective code ownership are key.  

My technical craft centers on OOP and SOLID principles, delivering state-of-the-art, decoupled, maintainable, reusable, clean, and testable code.  

I'm currently working on building modular Clean Architecture/DDD solutions with C# and ABP Framework 8.  

Additionally, I am actively adopting AI tools to achieve faster and higher-quality deliveries.  

It's an exciting time to build software faster, better, and cleaner.
